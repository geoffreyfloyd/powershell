# Powershell Startup Script
*Powershell configured for various dev environments*

# Install

- Open "Windows Powershell" as an administrator (Right click on link, then left click on "Run as Administrator")

- Run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted"

- Hit 'Y' to confirm

- Copy/clone the contents of this repo to a folder named `WindowsPowerShell` within your documents folder (`C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\WindowsPowerShell`)

  **NOTE: It is very important that it is named this exactly and that the contents of the repo are at the root level of the folder. This is where Powershell will search for your startup entry script: `index.ps1`**

- Close and Reopen Powershell

- Good to go!
